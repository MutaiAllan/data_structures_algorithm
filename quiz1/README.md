## ICS 2105 – Data Structures and Algorithms
# Quiz One
# :AIM:
To assist the student
1. Revise knowledge of the most common data structure – Arrays.
2. To help the student appreciate the importance of efficient approaches to problem
solving.
3. To help the student understand the decision choices and structuring of problems
for better solutions.


## TASKS
1. Question One (1) Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears
only once and returns the new length.
Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array
in-place with O(1) extra memory.
2. Question Two (2) - Rotate Array
Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.
3. Question Three (3) - Contains Duplicate
Given an array of integers, find if the array contains any duplicates.
Your function should return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and it should
return false if every element is distinct.
4. Question Four (4) - Single Number
Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find
that single one.


## HINT:
1. Always define your inputs, and outputs.
2. Try to start with the simplest solution you can think about, then
refine slowly ---- e.g. you can ask questions like: How can I reduce
storage? How can I reduce my code? How many operations does my
solution perform? Can I reduce these?
