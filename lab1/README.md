## Data Structures and Algorithms: LAB ONE [1]
# Aims
 To refresh the knowledge of Simple data structures such as arrays and structs
 To introduce the concept of UML notations used for ADT specification
 To cement knowledge of ADT specification and implementation.


# Task One (1)
Define two functions: summation and maximum both of which take an integer array of length
0<= n<= ∞. The summation function gets the sum of the integers while the maximum function
obtains the largest integer in the array.
Within the main function; declare an array of length n, obtain the n from the user, then allow the
user to enter these n integers storing them in the array. Call the two functions in turns and display
their outputs.

# Task two (2)
Given that a student ha the following details:
i. registration number (a string of at most 20 characters)
ii. name (A string of at most 50 characters)
iii. age (and integer)
iv. course (An object of a defined type course)
v. grades (An object of a defined type Grade)

A course has two major attributes namely:
i)
course_code: a string.
ii)
Course_name: a string
A grade has the following components:
i)
Mark: an integer between 0 and 100.
ii)
the_grade: a character obtained from the mark through a grading system (if mark>69
the_grade is A, if mark>59 but less than 70, the grade is B, if mark>49 but less than 60
the grade is C, if mark>39 but less than 50 then grade is D otherwise grade is E )
Using arrays and structures (structs), design this system and implement in C/C++ and be able to:
i)
Add at most 40 students.
ii)
Edit a student’s details
iii)
Add marks and calculate grades.
iv)
Ensure the grades, ones calculated, can not be altered.
Task Three (3)
Use C++ classes to represent the scenario above
Task Four (4)
Cary out a specification of ADT List using UML diagrams.
